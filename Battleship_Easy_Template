# initialize an empty board so that spaces can be appended to it later

# insert three rows of ["O","O","O"] into the board 

# create a function print_board to print the board

# create a function random_row to generate a random number that corresponds to the index of a row on the board

# create a function random_col to generate a random number that corresponds to the index of a column on the board

# print an intro message

# call print_board()

# create a variable called ship_row and assign it result of random_row()
# create a variable called ship_col and assign it result of random_col()
# create an integer called turn and set it to 1

# while turn is less then 5
    # print the turn number
    # get the row from the user and convert to index form
    # get the col from the user and convert to index form
    # check for the hit
        # if the player has hit the ship, congratulate them
        # if the input is invalid (out of range or has already been guessed), ask them to try again
        # if the player has missed, increment the turn and reflect the hit on the board (board[row][col] = "X") and print the board again
        # after four turns, print game over and reveal the location of the battleship
